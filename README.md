# nn

Introduction to learning with neural networks implemented in octave/matlab starting from the basic basics.

[nn0](nn0) - the simplest single linear neuron network even without bias term.

[nn1](nn1) - introducing bias terms and higher input and output dimensionality (multiple neurons)

[nn2](nn2) - introducing non-linear activation functions

[nn3](nn3) - multiple layers

[nn4](nn4) - self-normalizing neural networks

[nn5](nn5) - projecting errors through random matrices instead of transposed W
